```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I prepared this report while studying regular expression and their usage in R.  
I refer this page to revise regex and string functions.  
Hope this helps you too. `r emo::ji("relieved")`



```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(knitr)
#for emojis
if(!require(emo)) {devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")}
library(emo)

```

There are a lot of functions available both in base R & `stringr` package of tidyverse. Following table contains functions with similar functionality, in both packages.  

```{r}
base_R <- c()
```
